The purpose of the negotiation is to reach an agreement about the provision of a service by one agent for another. The model defines a range of strategies and tactics that agents can employ to generate initial offers, evaluate proposals and offer counter proposals. The model is based on computationally tractable assumptions, demonstrated in the domain of business process management and empirically evaluated. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

 @article{Jong_Tuyls_Verbeeck_2008, title={Fairness in multi-agent systems}, volume={23}, ISSN={0269-8889, 1469-8005}, DOI={10.1017/S026988890800132X}, abstractNote={Multi-agent systems are complex systems in which multiple autonomous entities, called agents, cooperate in order to achieve a common or personal goal. These entities may be computer software, robots, and also humans. In fact, many multi-agent systems are intended to operate in cooperation with or as a service for humans. Typically, multi-agent systems are designed assuming perfectly rational, self-interested agents, according to the principles of classical game theory. Recently, such strong assumptions have been relaxed in various ways. One such way is explicitly including principles derived from human behavior. For instance, research in the field of behavioral economics shows that humans are not purely self-interested. In addition, they strongly care about fairness. Therefore, multi-agent systems that fail to take fairness into account, may not be sufficiently aligned with human expectations and may not reach intended goals. In this paper, we present an overview of work in the area of fairness in multi-agent systems. More precisely, we first look at the classical agent model, that is, rational decision making. We then provide an outline of descriptive models of fairness, that is, models that explain how and why humans reach fair decisions. Then, we look at prescriptive, computational models for achieving fairness in adaptive multi-agent systems. We show that results obtained by these models are compatible with experimental and analytical results obtained in the field of behavioral economics.}, number={2}, journal={The Knowledge Engineering Review}, author={Jong, Steven De and Tuyls, Karl and Verbeeck, Katja}, year={2008}, month={Jun}, pages={153–180} }

However, research in the ﬁeld of behavioral economics shows that humans are not purely self-interested; they strongly care about whether their rewards are fair. Therefore, multi-agent systems that fail to take fairness into account, may not be sufﬁciently aligned with human expectations. Two important motivations for fairness have already been identiﬁed and modelled, being (i) inequity aversion and (ii) reciprocity. We identify a third motivation that has not yet been captured: priority awareness. We show how priorities may be modelled and discuss their relevance for multi-agent research.}, author={de Jong, Steven and Tuyls, Karl and Verbeeck, Katja and Roos, Nico}, pages={7} }

 @article{Rabin_1993, title={Incorporating Fairness into Game Theory and Economics}, volume={83}, ISSN={0002-8282}, abstractNote={People like to help those who are helping them, and to hurt those who are hurting them. Outcomes reflecting such motivations are called fairness equilibria. Outcomes are mutual-max when each person maximizes the other’s material payoffs, and mutual-min when each person minimizes the other’s payoffs. It is shown that every mutual-max or mutual-min Nash equilibrium is a fairness equilibrium. If payoffs are small, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of mutual-max and mutual-min outcomes; if payoffs are large, fairness equilibria are roughly the set of Nash equilibria. Several economic examples are considered, and possible welfare implications of fairness are explored.}, number={5}, journal={The American Economic Review}, author={Rabin, Matthew}, year={1993}, pages={1281–1302} }

Yet, there is no clear agreement on which definition to apply in each situation. Moreover, the detailed differences between multiple definitions are difficult to grasp. To address this issue, this paper collects the most prominent definitions of fairness for the algorithmic classification problem, explains the rationale behind these definitions, and demonstrates each of them on a single unifying case-study. Our analysis intuitively explains why the same case can be considered fair according to some definitions and unfair according to others.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the International Workshop on Software Fairness - FairWare ’18}, publisher={ACM Press}, author={Verma, Sahil and Rubin, Julia}, year={2018}, pages={1–7} }
